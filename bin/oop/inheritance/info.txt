IT is just llike parents where the traits of parents are passed to the children element this is called elements.The children 
can use the things of parents class and this is the interitance.
It allows you to create a new class from an existing class, reusing code and extending functionality instead of writing it 
from scratch.
we use extends keyboard like
class child extends Base(Parent class){
 
}
here child will have his own property but it will also inherit all the properties of the base(Parent class)

in inheritance the this is used to specify the data within the class while super is used to get from the parent element

Types of inheritance:
1.Single inheritance:One class extends another class

2.Multilevel Inheritance:Once class can exteends to another class and that antoher class itself can be parent for 
another third class this is the multilevel inheritance.

3.Multiple inheritance:(Is in other languages but not it java)
When one class is extending to more than one class is called multiple inheritance
Suppose classes A,B and C 
Here B inherits the property of A and C 
hence the B is the example of multiple inheritance.
(Not supported in java.if two or more varaiable have  same property the java will get confused)

We can do its major work using inteference!

4.Hierarchial Inheritance:
One class is inheritate by many classes
supposed classes A,B,C,D and B,C,D inherits fromn A ,this is the example of Hierarchial Inheritance
B,C,D has property of A but not of each others

5.Hybrid inheritance:(Not in java we will cover it in interfaces using other concept but not avaible easily and simply)
It is the combination of single and multiplication inheriance

//We can acieve the properties of multliple inheritance and hybrid inhertance using the propery of inteference
