IT is just llike parents where the traits of parents are passed to the children element this is called elements.The children 
can use the things of parents class and this is the interitance.
It allows you to create a new class from an existing class, reusing code and extending functionality instead of writing it 
from scratch.
we use extends keyboard like
class child extends Base(Parent class){
 
}
here child will have his own property but it will also inherit all the properties of the base(Parent class)
